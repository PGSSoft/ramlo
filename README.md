Command line tool based on Node.js for generating RESTful API documentations written in [RAML](http://raml.org/).

![Manageable API - documentation generated by ramlo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4398703/13664129/c19f846a-e6a5-11e5-84fe-f9ee5dfca9cf.png)

## Note
:boom: Because *ramlo* is currently during development and uses [RAML 1.0 JS Parser (beta)](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-js-parser-2), it is not finished yet and can be unstable.

It supports both RAML [0.8](http://raml.org/raml-08-spec) and [1.0](http://raml.org/raml-10-spec).

First tests performed on Node.js 5.8.0 and RAML 0.8 (see [Example](#example) section).

## Instalation
```
npm install -g ramlo
```

## Usage
```
ramlo -f api.raml
```

The output of this command is a HTML file called `api.html` which should have RESTful API documentation generated based on provided RAML file.

## Example
If you do not have any API documented in RAML you can look at my other project called [Manageably](https://github.com/zkamil/manageably-doc).

For testing please use API described in file `manageably-0.8.raml`.

More examples: [https://github.com/raml-apis](https://github.com/raml-apis)

## Mock Service
When you have API defined and documentation generated, you can run mock service. I recommend [Osprey Mock Service](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/osprey-mock-service). It generates an API mock service from a RAML definition using [Osprey](https://github.com/mulesoft/osprey).
```
npm install -g osprey-mock-service
```
Start the service from the CLI. This will automatically use the `baseUri` as the path to the mock service. For example, `http://example.com/api` will result in `http://localhost:{PORT}/api`.
```
osprey-mock-service -f api.raml -p 8000
```
:boom: Unfortunately Osprey Mock Service does not support RAML 1.0, only RAML 0.8.
